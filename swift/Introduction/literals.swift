// Literals are representations of fixed values in a program.
// They can be numbers, characters, or strings, etc. For example, "Hello, World!", 12, 23.0, "C", etc.

let siteName = "Apple.com"
// In the above expression, siteName is a variable, and "Apple.com" is a literal.

// Integer Literals
// Integer literals are those that do not have a fractional or an exponential part.
// There are four types of integer literals in Swift:

// Type	        Example	        Remarks
// Decimal	    5, 10, -68	    Regular numbers.
// Binary	    0b101, 0b11	    Start with 0b.
// Octal	    0o13	        Start with 0o.
// Hexadecimal	0x13	        Start with 0x.

// Floating-point Literals
// Floating-point literals are numeric literals that have floating decimal points. For example,
let piValue: Float = 3.14
// Here, 3.14 is a floating-point literal assigned to the piValue constant.

// Boolean Literals
// There are two boolean literals: true and false.
let pass: Bool = true
// Here, true is a boolean literal assigned to pass.

// String and Character Literals
// Character literals are Unicode characters enclosed in double-quotes. For example,
let someCharacter: Character = "S"
// Here, S is a character literal assigned to someCharacter.

// Similarly, String literals are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes ".
let someString: String = "Swift is fun" 
// Here, "Swift is fun" is a string literal assigned to someString.
