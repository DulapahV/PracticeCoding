// Data abstraction is the concept of providing only essential information to the outside world. 
// It's a process of representing essential features without including implementation details.

// A good real-world example is a book: When you hear the term book, you don't know the exact specifics, 
// i.e.: the page count, the color, the size, but you understand the idea of a book - the abstraction of the book.

// The concept of abstraction is that we focus on essential qualities, 
// rather than the specific characteristics of one particular example.

// Abstraction allows us to write a single bank account class, and then create different objects based on the class, 
// for individual bank accounts, rather than creating a separate class for each bank account.
