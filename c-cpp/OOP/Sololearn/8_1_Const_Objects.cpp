// A constant is an expression with a fixed value. It cannot be changed while the program is running.
// Use the const keyword to define a constant variable.

const int x = 42;

// All constant variables must be initialized at the time of their creation.

// As with the built-in data types, we can make class objects constant by using the const keyword.

// const MyClass obj;

// Once a const class object has been initialized via the constructor, 
// you cannot modify the object's member variables. 
// This includes both directly making changes to public member variables and calling 
// member functions that set the value of member variables.

// When you've used const to declare an object, you can't change its data members during the object's lifetime.
