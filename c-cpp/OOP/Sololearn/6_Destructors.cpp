// Remember constructors? They're special member functions that are automatically called when an object is created.
// Destructors are special functions, as well. They're called when an object is destroyed or deleted.

// Objects are destroyed when they go out of scope, or whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer directed at an object of a class.
