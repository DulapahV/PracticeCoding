// Encapsulation means more than simply combining attributes and behavior together within a class; 
// it also means restricting access to the inner workings of that class.

// This is called data hiding.

// For example, if we take our BankAccount class, we do not want some other part of our program to reach 
// in and change the balance of any object, without going through the deposit() or withdraw() behaviors.

// In summary the benefits of encapsulation are:
// - Control the way data is accessed or modified.
// - Code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.
// - Change one part of code without affecting other part of code.
