// In a C++ program, memory is divided into two parts:
// The stack: All of your local variables take up memory from the stack.
// The heap: Unused program memory that can be used when the program runs to dynamically allocate the memory.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    new int;
    // This allocates the memory size necessary for storing an integer on the heap, and returns that address.
}
