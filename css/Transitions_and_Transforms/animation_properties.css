/*
The animation-direction indicates how the keyframe should be applied.
The values can be set as:
normal - the default value, which means it plays forward from 0 % to 100%.
reverse - plays the keyframe in an opposite direction from 100 % to 0%
alternate - the animation first runs forward, then backward, then forward.
alternate-reverse - the animation first runs backward, then forward, then backward.

	animation-name: colorchange;
	animation-duration: 3s;
	animation-timing-function: ease-in;

can be combined into
