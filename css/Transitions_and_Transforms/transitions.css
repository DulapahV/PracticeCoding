/*
The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
It can have the following values:
ease - the animation starts slowly, then accelerates quickly.
ease-in - starts slowly, then accelerates, and stops abruptly.
ease-out - starts quickly, but decelerates to a stop.
ease-in-out - similar to ease, but with more subtle acceleration and deceleration.
linear - constant speed throughout the animation; often best for color or opacity changes.

Finally, we have cubic-bezier(), which allows you to define your own values in 
the cubic-bezier function. Possible values are numeric values from 0 to 1.
