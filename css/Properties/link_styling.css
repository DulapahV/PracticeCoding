/* When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:
- a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
- a:active MUST come after a:hover

a:link - defines the style for normal unvisited links
a:visited - defines the style for visited links
a:active - a link becomes active once you click on it
a:hover - a link is hovered when the mouse is over it
*/

a:hover {
	color: red;
}

/*
The following properties are used to control the look and feel of links:
border:none - removes border from images with links
outline:none - removes the dotted border on clicked lines in IE
*/

a:link {
	text-decoration: none;
}
