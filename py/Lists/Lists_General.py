# List Items
# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

# Ordered
# When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
# If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

# Changeable
# The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

# Allow Duplicates
# Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:


thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
# Can be also written as thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"))
print(thislist)
print(len(thislist))
