# Dictionary
# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and does not allow duplicates.
# Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)  # {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 1964}

# Dictionary Items
# Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
# Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])  # Ford

# Changeable
# Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

# Duplicates Not Allowed
# Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
# Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)  # {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 2020}

# Dictionary Length
# To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:
print(len(thisdict))  # 3
