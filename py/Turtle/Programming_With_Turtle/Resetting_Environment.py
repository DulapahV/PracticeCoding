# You also have the option to start on a clean slate with a reset command. The screen will get cleared up, and the
# turtle’s settings will all be restored to their default parameters. All you need to to do is type in the following
# command:

# t.reset()

# This clears the screen and takes the turtle back to its home position. Your default settings, like the turtle’s size,
# shape, color, and other features, will also be restored.
